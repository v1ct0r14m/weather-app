# weather-app
for module 6

## description

The point of the project geared me to create an application that can display the weather for a city a user were to visit or was just curious to see.
i built this project because i wanted to push myself to create an application i was actually proud , thus far. it should reduce the uncertainty over the current and future weather forecast for searched city, for up to 5 days, while also saving previously searched cities.through this process, i was able to gain an understanding on the capacity web API's have to alter a user's experience, along with construct dynamic or engaging web applications using web API's.

## installation

n/a - the application is browser-only.

## usage
